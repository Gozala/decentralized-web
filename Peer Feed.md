# Peer Feed

## Idea

What if every browser had a built-in feed for posting messages (text, links, media) that other browsers could subscribe to forming a decentralized messaging network. Messages could be encrypted to restrict access to desired recepients for private messaging or stay unencripted for publish messages. Pretty much like RSS feed but without requiring a server component or XML. Different webapp client then could be used to display & post to those feeds (think facebook or twitter) without locking you into their service, in fact that may provide a venue for competition with giants of social network without high infrastructure costs. Data will be owned and hosted by authors and replecated by subscribers.

### Features

- Decentralized social network.
- End to end encryption.
- Allow users to break out of cylos.
- User could build and own social graphs.
- Promote competition instead of lock-in.
- Would work offline.
- Allows democratization of removal of content (For example if President elect removes posted message, it would get removed only if most peers agree)
- Banning a content could be democratize (If most peers blacklist content it becomes hardly discoverable).
- Site annotations could also get published into the feed (Facts checking website could provide anotaions to popular content to provide notes about it's validity, allowing subscribed peers to see inline anotations as they browse web).
