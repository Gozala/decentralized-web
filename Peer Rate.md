# Peer Rate

## Problem

Product ratings on different store websites provide a valuable information when considering a purchase. For better or worse you often can not followup with a reviewer. Some services don't even provide rating systems and some are pretty sketchy containing no negative rates.

## Idea

What if with a distributed web we could create a peer rate feed as a service, allowing peers to submit reviews / ratings, allow peers to subscribe to the feed and view ratings inline, allow peers to upvote / downvote reviews, allow direct messaging with reviewers. Each peer on the network could have profile with inbox & a feed with multiple channels (one of them colud be for peer reviews) allowing them to post to reviews and recieve messages in inbox on followups. This way uniform and reliable rating system could become available for the whole (de)centralized web.
